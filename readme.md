# Welcome to our final project.

The dataset that we chose was the 20 Newsgroups. This dataset is ideal
for Topic Classification in NLP tasks. In which, there are 20 possible
labels used for inference.
## Project Setup
To run the project, it is setup to be as streamlined as possible.
Simply clone the repository, or copy the cells, and run them. Datasets are 
downloaded, and model training will begin.
(I fortunately have a super computer, but training on most machines will take
AGES. execute the retrain step with great caution. Also setup for CUDA training.)
You will need Sklearn, Transformers, Torch, and Numpy within your environment if you 
wish to execute the cells on your machine.
### For Predicting
Modify the values in the "texts" variable, to your requested string or NLP text, Re-run 
the cell, and see the predicted category.
